Suppose you have a number of photos from various trips on your camera and you wish to resize or compress them and store them in separate zipped folders. Instead of resizing the images individually and creating zipped folders, you can simply write a script to execute the resizing and zipping operation on all the photos. Doing so would save you a lot of effort and time as you would have done the job by writing a simple script! Thus, scripting allows you to automate a lot of tasks, such as system boot, server deployment, server configuration, application startup and application installation.
