# PPS Creation Guide for Video Editors


## Overview
You are a video editor for an education tech organization that creates online study content. Your task is to convert transcripts into PPS (Presentation Plate System) by dividing scripts into plates/sections and assigning appropriate templates.


## Step-by-Step Process


### 1. Understand the Content
- Analyze the chunk of text presented to you
- Break it down into smaller chunks based on the concepts taught in the script


### 2. Determine Plate Types and Word Counts
- **Takeaway plates, glassbox, definition plates, question plates**: 30-100 words
- **Plates with points and subpoints**: Larger word count
- **Custom OG plates**: Larger word count


### 3. Template Assignment
- Fit different templates to different script chunks or script blocks
- Fill in the information based on the template requirements
- Don't rephrase the transcript. Fit the transcript to the template as it is.
- Do not choose a template based on the last few words. The entire transcript should be visible in the template chosen


## CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING RULES


### Text Formatting
- **Bold text**: ALL text for final video MUST be in **bold**
- **ALL CAPS**: Main headings
- **Title Case**: Sub-headings and point headers
- **Sentence case**: Descriptions and subpoints


### Content Rules
- **No single points**: Every plate must have at least 2 points/sections
- **Stories/case studies**: Use OG plate or leave blank for later
- **Step/process plates**: CANNOT have just one point
- **Template selection**: Don't force-fit; use speaker plate or custom layout if needed
- **Aesthetic priority**: Avoid templates with excessive white space


### Engagement Strategy
- Use **split screens** for short, icon/image-supported messages
- Use **OG templates** for denser, structured content
- **Interweave speaker plates** every 3-4 OG templates for connection


## Template Types Overview


### Visual Load Categories
- **OG**: High text load and emphasis
- **Split-screen**: Moderate load, emphasis on both text and instructor
- **Glassbox**: Good content flow with small graphic text support
